# Title: Unveiling Patterns: Analyzing Mobile Phone Prices in Relation to Human Characteristics using R

## Introduction
Embark on a profound exploration of a dataset that reveals nuanced connections between mobile phone prices and diverse human attributes. This project meticulously investigates features such as marital status, education, income, age, and user preferences, seeking to unveil intricate patterns that shape mobile phone pricing decisions.

## Code Overview
The R code provided takes you through a comprehensive journey, covering data loading, detailed statistics, and immersive visualizations including histograms, QQ-plots, and boxplots. The analysis extends to ANOVA tests, Pearson correlation, and the construction of predictive linear regression models.

## Predictive Modeling
Beyond exploration, this project includes the development of predictive models to forecast mobile phone prices based on human attributes. Witness the stepwise refinement of accuracy through the implementation of linear regression models.

## Findings
In-depth findings and nuanced analyses are encapsulated in the attached PDF report. Please note that the report is presented in Greek, aligning with the requirements of this semester project.
